# RGB LED Control

This project allows you to control an RGB LED strip using a web interface. You can adjust the red, green, and blue values to create different colors and control the brightness of the LED strip.
And before you ask i wanted sliders instead of a color picker!
## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 microcontroller
- RGB LED strip
- Power supply for the LED strip
- Wires for connections
- Internet connection

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/blit-oni/arduino-led-webserve
2. Install the required libraries mentioned in the Arduino code.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to the ESP8266 microcontroller.
4. Connect the RGB LED strip to the appropriate pins on the microcontroller.
5. Connect the power supply to the LED strip.
6. Ensure that your device is connected to the same network as the ESP8266.
7. Open a web browser and enter the IP address of the ESP8266 to access the control interface.

## Usage

- Open the web interface in a browser by accessing the IP address of the ESP8266.
- Use the sliders to adjust the red, green, and blue values to create different colors.
- Adjust the brightness slider to control the brightness of the LED strip.
- Click the "Toggle Strip" button to enable or disable the LED strip.
